# Tokio Doc Blitz

Welcome to the Tokio doc blitz effort. The goal is to organize a
concerted community effort to improve the Tokio documentation while also
gaining new contributors. At the end, we hope to have a significantly
improved set of [guides] and [API documentation][api].

The Tokio doc blitz can use the help of all, **no matter the level of
familiarity with Tokio**.

[guides]: https://tokio.rs/docs
[api]: http://docs.rs/tokio

## Process

The steps are roughly:

1) Structure an [outline] of what we would like the Tokio guides to be.
2) Community members pick topics from the outline that they are familiar
   with and contribute guides.
3) New community members still unfamiliar with Tokio read the new
   guides, documenting questions and blockers they hit.
4) Update the guide outline based on the feedback, and repeat the
   process.

This git repository will be used to coordinate the effort. The current
outline is found [here][outline] and dicussion are in issues.
