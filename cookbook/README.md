This folder contains the source for the tokio cookbook, in mdbook format.

*Note*: This file just documents this folder and isn't part of the book itself.

To build the book, first install mdbook:

    cargo install mdbook

And then build the docs and serve them via local web server (http://localhost:3000/):

    mdbook serve

For more details on `mdbook`, see it's [project website](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook)
