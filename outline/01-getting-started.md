The getting started guides start with a Tutorial then go into a high
level tour of necessary knowledge for being productive with Tokio.

# Guides:

* [Hello world!](https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/hello-world/)
* [Runtime model](https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/runtime-model/)
* [Futures](https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/futures/)
* [Tasks](https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/tasks/)
* [Example: A Chat Server](https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/chat/)

# Issues

* The guide contains a [I/O with
  Tokio](https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/io/) section. This
  section is currently poor. The current plan is to create a guide
  section dedicated to [I/O](#4). Should the getting started section
  have a high level I/O introduction? If so, what should be covered?

* There is no mention of how to implement a client. All examples use
  servers.

* There is no mention of thread-local variables being used to manage task notification.
